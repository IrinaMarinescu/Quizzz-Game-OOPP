  - comment and close issue if we don't want to use issues anymore (comment something like 'issue no longer relevant' or 'issue split into other issues' and link the other issues)
 - [14:45] Closure

 - Testing: so far, Per wrote a template for testing and we have a few tests, but there is not a lot of testing so far
 - Unit test everything we make
 - Additional tests are not a big part of the grading requirement, but every code should be tested to the best of our knowledge
 - There is some database testing already
 - 'Fetch random activity' testing: either look for a way in which the random can be seeded and try passing a seed in some way or don't spend too much time on it, because one untested method will not be that big of a problem
 - Is it okay to make everything public for the sake of testing? We can make it package access
 - Private helper methods do not have to be tested and can therefore still be private
 
 - List of deadlines: by the end of this week we have to hand in the teamwork assignment 4a, the final HCI assignment and upload the questions to the activity bank
 - Next week we will have to fill out the BuddyCheck where we have to review our peers in specific metrics and these comments will be shown to the other peer in an anonymous fashion
 - Be honest and use it as a chance to say anything you want to say
 - Go to somebody and contact TAs, the course staff or the academic counsellors if you feel discriminated against; concerns will be documented
