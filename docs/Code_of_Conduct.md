# Code of Conduct

In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary.

### Assignment description:

*In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group in this course.*

In this course we need to program a functioning multiplayer quiz application. At the same time, we are developing our teamworking and communication skills, including how to conduct organized meetings and how to deal with decision making within teams. In addition, we are learning how to use the tools and technologies for app development, such as Git, Spring and SceneBuilder.

### Target or ambition level:

*What grade are you working for?*

We are aiming for an 8, but this means that we will have to go beyond simply the ‘must-haves’ and ‘should-haves’ of the backlog. Therefore, we will aim to also implement some of the ‘could-haves’ to guarantee us a high grade that we as a team will be satisfied with.

### Products:

*What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)? What standards must the work submitted meet?*

At the end of this project, we will deliver a quiz application with a functioning front-end and back-end. The game has to have a solo player and a multiplayer game mode, in which different question types about various activities and their energy consumptions will be asked. Within our group, we share documents on a shared Google Drive folder. Additionally, we communicate via WhatsApp and Discord, and share our code on Gitlab. Before we submit our work, the group has to agree with the standard, which means that for the written assignments the entire group has to approve the submission, and for the code at least two people have to approve the code before merging it on Gitlab. 

### Planning:

*How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submit it to Brightspace on behalf of the project group?*

Every week, we have a meeting on Monday where we discuss the deadlines in the upcoming week. We split up the tasks and set issues and milestones on Gitlab. We also set ourselves internal deadlines to finish the deliverables that are one or two days before the actual deadlines, so that we can approve them as a group before submission. As stated before, the entire group will give their approval for written submission and at least two people will approve code before merging.

### Behaviour:

*How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?*

We treat each other with respect and patience and will consider each other’s opinions and ideas with consideration and thoughtfulness. We will also ensure that no-one is left behind by creating an atmosphere in which no one feels unwelcome or insecure about asking questions. Disagreements will be voted upon and as a last resort we will come to the TA and ask for advice. If someone is late, it has to be announced beforehand and they have to bring cookies to the next meeting.

### Communication:

*In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? (in the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)*

We communicate in English in a polite, slightly informal manner. Our communication within the group will be conducted in weekly meetings, as well as over WhatsApp and Discord. The communication with the TA will be conducted over Mattermost.

### Commitment:

*How do you determine the quality of each group's work, so that each member delivers the same quality? How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?*

As previously mentioned, we will all provide feedback on written assignments before submission and we will provide feedback on code on Gitlab. This allows for the entire group to assess each other’s work and holds everyone accountable to provide work that is up to standard. Furthermore, we will make the best use of the weekly sessions with the TA by asking him to provide us with feedback for the work that we have done over the past week. We will assess the commitment of the chairs and minute-takers again by making use of the group assessment principle: the chair has to upload their agenda on Gitlab before our meeting, which means that the entire group can look at it beforehand and note anything that has to be changed or that is not up to par in advance. This communication will happen over WhatsApp or Discord. 

### Meetings:

*How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?*

In addition to the scheduled meetings with the TA on Tuesday, we will meet once a week in our own time. This meeting will be on Mondays and will be an opportunity to go over the week we have done in the previous week, as well as scheduling and assigning the tasks for the coming week. Additionally, we will schedule Discord calls whenever an extra meeting is necessary.

### Decision-making:

*How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?*

Ideally, we will make decisions by consensus. This means that everybody explains the advantages and disadvantages of their idea. However, if the group still doesn’t agree, then we will take a vote and the decision that the majority votes will be implemented.

### Dealing with conflicts:

*How do you handle conflicts within the group?*

We try our best to talk it out and be respectful. If the majority agrees on the decision made, we just move on. If we can’t reach a conclusion, we will ask the TA for assistance. Overall, most conflicts will be treated the same way we do with decision-making. 

### Guidance:

*What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?*

We expect that the TA clearly explains the assignments and expectations for the project, as well as providing us with feedback on our work. We will schedule feedback for our work from the previous week in our agenda and hope that the TA can give us advice on what to improve. Additionally, we would like the TA to be a person who can advise us on our collaboration as a team. 

### Consequences:

*What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?*

The first time a person does not meet a deadline or provides work that is below the standard of the group, we will discuss it with them and give them a warning. However, if the same person does not keep up with the group agreements again, then we will ask the TA for advice. 

### Success factors:

*What makes your team a dream team?*

When we completed the first teamwork assignment, we saw that all teamwork roles are present in our group. This means that we are a well-balanced group, to which everyone can contribute their own strengths. Additionally, we are motivated and want to do our best to succeed as a group!
